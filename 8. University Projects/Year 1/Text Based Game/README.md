**Text Based Game**
---

**Version 1**
---

In version one I was asked to create a basic text-based game in the style of Zork.  
The game is designed to be played by entering various commands e.g "move south", "look", "get key"), to which my game should return a text based output like "You pick up the rusty key".  

I was tasked with creating my own narrative for the game of any genre and the game must consist of rooms which can be travelled to and the player can perform actions in.    
The game must also present puzzles to the player, the puzzles must involve the player using an item from their inventory they have previously collected.  
The game must also provide a score based on puzzles solved and rooms visited the formula is: (startingScore - rooms + puzzles)*PUZZLE_SCORE  

And finally the game must display a text-based map of the world as the user explores.
