# 🏢 Data Centre Security Project

This repository contains a comprehensive security analysis and documentation project for a **fictional data centre**.  
The project includes a fully designed **facility blueprint**, detailed **physical, administrative, and technical security controls**, and a professionally structured **LaTeX report**.



## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design, document, and analyse the security posture of a fictional data centre environment.  
It includes:

- Physical security measures  
- Administrative policies and procedures  
- Technical and network security controls  
- Threat analysis and risk assessment  
- Incident response planning  
- Business continuity and disaster recovery documentation  
- Blueprint of the data centre layout with security annotations  

This project demonstrates an understanding of **industry-standard best practices**, alignment with government/compliance requirements, and systematic documentation of security controls.



## 🧱 Blueprint

A custom blueprint was created showing:

- CCTV camera coverage  
- Biometric fingerprint scanners  
- Keycard access points  
- Facial recognition barriers  
- Server, network, storage, and electrical rooms  
- Office areas, meeting room, reception, lounge, and more  

The blueprint serves as the foundation for the physical security section of the report.
