**- Web Log Analysis**
--- 

This series introduced me to log files which are produced by web application servers and how they can be interpreted. I was shown how to use common command-line tools to analyze the log artifacts, what you can infer from the information captured in logs, and how this information can be helpful when responding to a suspected incident.

Here is the badge I recieved for finishing the module and also the link to view my completion.
