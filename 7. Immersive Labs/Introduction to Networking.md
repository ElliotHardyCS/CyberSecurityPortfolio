**- Introduction to Networking**
--- 

This series focused on core networking concepts and the basics. I was introduced to the basics of networking connectivity, network topologies and general networking concepts including IP addresses and DNS. This alongside the knowledge gained during my A-Level computer science qualification has given me a strong networking foundation.

Here is the badge I recieved for finishing the module and also the link to view my completion.
