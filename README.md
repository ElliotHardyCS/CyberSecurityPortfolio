## About Me:
I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham. I completed my A-levels in Maths, Physics, Computer Science (grades A, A, A), and an EPQ (grade B) at Bishop Stopford School. During my A-levels, I was awarded a scholarship to join the "Future Engineering Leaders" course by Impetus Education Ltd. I also led my school's Sixth Form National Cipher Challenge team and competed in the Cyber Centurion competition run by the US Air Force Association.  

Before A-levels, I earned 9 GCSEs from The Latimer Arts College in 2022.  
Currently, I work as a Server at Miller and Carter, where Iâ€™ve developed skills in teamwork, communication, and customer service. Previously, I was employed as a Theatre Technician, responsible for the lighting production of various shows, which honed my ability to perform under pressure.  

In addition to my studies, I Volunteered as a Student Teacher at a local dance school, where I ensured the safety and performance of younger dancers. I am also pursuing my RAD Grade 7, and have recently completed my RAD Repertoire qualification in ballet and scored a Merit in my grade 6 ballet exam and have achieved Grade 5 in violin.
