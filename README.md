-About Me:  
    -I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham. I completed my A-levels in Maths, Physics, Computer Science (grades A, A, A), and an EPQ (grade B) at Bishop Stopford School. During my A-levels, I was awarded a scholarship to join the "Future Engineering Leaders" course by Impetus Education Ltd. I also led my school's Sixth Form National Cipher Challenge team and competed in the Cyber Centurion competition run by the US Air Force Association.  
    -Before A-levels, I earned 9 GCSEs from The Latimer Arts College in 2022.  
  -Currently, I work as a Server at Miller and Carter, where Iâ€™ve developed skills in teamwork, communication, and customer service. Previously, I was employed as a Theatre Technician, responsible for the lighting production of various shows, which honed my ability to perform under pressure.  
    -In addition to my studies, I Volunteered as a Student Teacher at a local dance school, where I ensured the safety and performance of younger dancers. I am also pursuing my RAD Grade 7, and have recently completed my RAD Repetoire qualification in ballet and scored a Merit in my grade 6 ballet exam and have achieved Grade 5 in violin.  


-Acknowledgements:  
    -I would like to thank the University of Birmingham for providing a strong foundation in computer science and cybersecurity. Additionally, platforms like Hack The Box and ImmersiveLabs have been instrumental in gaining hands-on experience and honing my technical skills.
