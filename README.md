## About Me:
I am a Second year Computer Science student at the University of Birmingham. In my first year of university I took 6 modules and achieved a year average of 78%, alongside my studies I made use of the university's excellent lectures and talks scheme, I became a mentee for an industry professional in a space I want to work in, and participated in many societies.

Previous to university I completed my A-levels in Maths, Physics, Computer Science (grades A, A, A), and an EPQ (grade B) at Bishop Stopford School. During my A-levels, I was awarded a scholarship to join the "Future Engineering Leaders" course by Impetus Education Ltd. I also led my school's Sixth Form National Cipher Challenge team and competed in the Cyber Centurion competition run by the US Air Force Association in which as a solo competitor I placed 79th out of close to 300 teams.

Before A-levels, I earned 9 GCSEs from The Latimer Arts College in 2022.

Currently, I work as a Server at Miller and Carter, where I’ve developed skills in teamwork, communication, and customer service. Previously, I was employed as a Theatre Technician, responsible for the lighting production of various shows, which honed my ability to perform under pressure.

In addition to my studies, I Volunteered as a Student Teacher at a local dance school, where I ensured the safety and performance of younger dancers. I am also pursuing my RAD Grade 7, and have recently completed my RAD Repetoire qualification in ballet.
