**Certified in Cybersecurity**
--- 

I am pleased to share that after lots of hardwork and revision I have now officially recieved my Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification from ISC2. 🎉


This course has allowed me to develop and hone my skills in a range of domains including; Access Controls Concepts, Business Continuity (BC) Concepts, Disaster Recovery (DR) Concepts, Incident Response Concepts, Network Security, Security Operations, and Security Principles. 👨‍💻


I am grateful to ISC2 for the opportunity to be able to complete this certificate using the one million pledge. 🏆


This opportunity has broadened my cyber security horizons and taught me invaluable skills that I can bring to any future job roles. 📚
